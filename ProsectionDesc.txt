Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and "right breast mass, 2 long stitches = anterior, 1 long one short stitch = superior, 2 short stitches = posterior, wire protruding laterally" is a 43 g tan-yellow, irregular, oriented portion of fibroadipose tissue measuring 4.4 cm medial to lateral, 4.0 cm anterior to posterior and 5.5 cm superior to inferior. The needle localization wire enters laterally and is visualized in the superior tear, but does not exit the specimen. The specimen is oriented with 2 long stitches anteriorly, one long one short stitch superiorly, 2 short stitches posteriorly, and a wire protruding laterally. The specimen is inked as follows: superior-blue, inferior-green, medial-red, lateral-orange, anterior-yellow and posterior-black. The specimen is sectioned from superior to inferior into 8 slices (superior is slice 1, average slice thickness 0.6 cm) to reveal a a 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.3 cm tan-white ill-defined previous site of biopsy with surrounding dense white fibrous tissue, fat necrosis, and subtle hemorrhage in slice 3-5. The lesion is 1.7 cm to the medial, 0.2 cm to the lateral, 0.2 cm to the anterior, 1.5 cm to the posterior, 1.0 cm to the superior and 2.3 cm to the inferior margin. The remaining cut surface is approximately less than 5% white fibrous tissue and greater than 95% yellow adipose tissue. Gross photographs are taken. Representative sections are submitted per diagram in 19 cassettes as:
1-2-superior, slice #1
3-4-slice #2
5-8-slice #3
9-12-slice #4
13-14-slice #5
15-16-slice #6
17-slice #7
18-19- inferior,slice #8
